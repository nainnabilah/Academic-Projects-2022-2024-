## üåü Introduction

This project is designed to cater to the curiosity of Pok√©mon enthusiasts by providing them with visually appealing and informative insights into the Pok√©mon universe. From identifying the strongest Pok√©mon to exploring the most common type combinations, this project uses data visualisation to make sense of a vast and complex dataset.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Visualise Pok√©mon based on their overall strength.**
- **Identify the most prevalent Pok√©mon type combinations.**
- **Determine which generation introduced the most new Pok√©mon.**
- **Explore which Pok√©mon have the highest defense or attack stats.**

These questions were chosen to align with the interests of Pok√©mon fans so that the visualisations are relevant, yet arresting.

## üìä Data Overview

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's "The Complete Pok√©mon Dataset" by Rounak Banik. It includes information on 802 Pok√©mon from seven generations, with attributes like:
- Name (English and Japanese)
- Type(s)
- Base Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- Height, Weight, and more!

This dataset was processed and transformed using Tableau through several methods including:
- **Data Type Conversion**: Adjusting the data types for variables like `generation` (integer to string) and `is_legendary` (integer to Boolean) for better analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables, such as `percentage_female` and `average_stats` using formulae to answer specific curiosities.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualisations

Here are some of the key visualisations you can explore:
- **The Strongest Pok√©mon:** Discover which Pok√©mon have the highest average stats.
- **Most Common Type Combinations:** See which type combinations are the most prevalent across all generations.
- **Generational Pok√©mon Introduction:** Find out which generation introduced the most new Pok√©mon.
- **Top Attack and Defense Stats:** Explore the Pok√©mon with the highest attack and defense stats.

These visualisations are designed to be both explanatory (highlighting key insights) and exploratory (allowing users to find their own insights).

## üìö Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualisation in understanding and appreciating the complexities of the Pok√©mon universe. By presenting data in an accessible and visually appealing format, we can help fans make more informed decisions in their Pok√©mon battles and gain a deeper understanding of the franchise.
